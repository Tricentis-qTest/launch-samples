## How to use this repository

- Each directory contains a sample application and a README file with instructions on how to set up an agent with a parser.
- Before you start your Host (agentctl), make sure to install all the prerequisites for the sample application you want to use,
because Host needs to have available tools such as Maven, JMeter...
- After you have installed the prerequisites, you can start the Host and set up the agent with the parser according to the instructions in the README file.
