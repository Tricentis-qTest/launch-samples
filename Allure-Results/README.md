# Allure Results Sample Application

Based on [junit-sample](https://github.com/QASymphony/junit-sample) repository and Allure Report
[documentation](https://allurereport.org/docs/junit4/).

Allure Report can take the results of your JUnit (or other test framework) tests and present them in a more readable format.

## Testing Host (automation) integrated with Launch (automation-hub)

### Prerequisites
On your Host:
1. Install [JDK 8](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-8-ug/downloads-list.html), sadly you cannot use newer for Allure 1 as it not supported for some time.
See below how to set up the agent without JDK.
2. Install [Maven 3.8.8](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).

### Agent Setup
1. **Agent Name**: e.g. _Allure-Agent_
2. **qTest Manager Project**: e.g. _Sample Project_
3. **Agent Type**: _Universal Agent_
4. **Pre-Execute-Script**: Leave empty.
5. **Executor**: _batch_ (Windows) or _shell_ (Linux or Mac)
6. **Working Directory**:
    - _C:\launch-sample-applications\Allure-Results_ (Windows)
    - _/usr/local/var/launch-sample-applications/Allure-Results_ (Linux or Mac)
7. **Execute Command**:
   ```shell
   mvn clean test
   ```
8. **Path to Results**:
    - _C:\launch-sample-applications\Allure-Results\target\allure-results_ (Windows)
    - _/usr/local/var/launch-sample-applications/Allure-Results/target/allure-results_ (Linux or Mac)
9. **Result Parser**: _Allure Results_

### Agent Setup without JDK
Since it would be annoying to install JDK 8 and switch to it just for this sample, the repo contains folder with 
test results already generated by Allure. You can use the following setup without JDK.

1. **Agent Name**: e.g. _Allure-Agent_
2. **qTest Manager Project**: e.g. _Sample Project_
3. **Agent Type**: _Universal Agent_
4. **Pre-Execute-Script**: Leave empty.
5. **Executor**: _batch_ (Windows) or _shell_ (Linux or Mac)
6. **Working Directory**: Leave empty.
7. **Execute Command**:
   ```shell
   echo noop
    ```
8. **Path to Results**:
   - _C:\launch-sample-applications\Allure-Results\example-allure-results_ (Windows)
   - _/usr/local/var/launch-sample-applications/Allure-Results/example-allure-results_ (Linux or Mac)
9. **Result Parser**: _Allure Results_
